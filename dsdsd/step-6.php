                    applicable deadlines to your particular situation, as

                    Please comprehend the distinction: We are a technology
                    platform that aids in the creation of forms and not a law
                    entity or legal service provider. In the event that you
                    purchase one or more than one package that is inclusive of
                    cease and desist, assignment of trademark letters, or other
                    forms, you will be eligible to a form document that is
                    inclusive of the information provided by you or from your
                    uploaded files. We are not a legal alternative, making us
                    ineligible for proving you with legal suggestions. Our
                    customer service representatives are not required to answer
                    any of your legal queries, nor will they entertain any law
                    related conversations. Any information transmissions between
                    yourself and our customer service representatives are not
                    monitored and thus, you should refrain from sharing any
                    confidential information with them. We provide assistance in
                    the preparation of your trademark application but cannot
                    file it for you as your counsel of record. We are not
                    responsible for providing you with any legal advice related

                  <p>
                    We may voluntarily, but by no contractual binding are
                    required to review the data you provide us with for
                    completeness, fraudulence, or administrative errors. Under
                    no specified instances are we responsible for reviewing your
                    provided answers for legal accuracy, legal counsel, advice,
                    or opinions. We do not review your data for any legal
                    purposes, nor do we provide legal recommendations about
                    legal rights, remedies, defenses, options, selection of
                    forms, or strategies, or apply the law to the facts of your

                    In the event that you are under the assumption that you have

                  <h4>SEARCH SERVICES</h4>
                  <p>
                    If you utilize our search services, we use commercially and
                    professionally reasonable methods to identify marks that may
                    be tallied with the ones you seek to use. We, however,
                    cannot guarantee that your mark will make it through and be
                    approved even if you use our search services. There may be a
                    number of reasons the USPTO rejects your mark and there are
                    circumstances where an automated search may not be able to
                    identify a mark the USPTO qualifies as a reason for
                    rejection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Similarly, when your order is inclusive of common law mark
                    searches, we use commercially justifiable methods to
                    identify marks that may be an equal match to the ones you
                    seek to use. We, however, do not guarantee that your mark
                    will be absent of or prevailing all claims or challenges
                    made by holders of common law rights to all marks. There are
                    amongst some of the instances where an automated search may
                    not be able to identify a regular law mark that may be
                    similar to your mark
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The aim of the search report is to give you with the
                    necessary marks to satisfy the parameters identified for the
                    specific kind of search you use. It is not designed to be a
                    legal framework or legal advice as to whether your proposed
                    mark will be dismissed, or whether it would be considered
                    resembling to another mark. You may want to seek the counsel
                    of an attorney regarding the outcomes of the search report
                    we furnish you.

                    Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any
                    court having jurisdiction. This arbitration provision shall
                    survive: i) the termination of the Agreement; or ii) the
                    bankruptcy of any party. If any portion of this arbitration

                    SUPPORT@ustrademarkpros.com WITH THE SUBJECT LINE “OPT-OUT'
                    AND INCLUDE: (1) YOUR NAME, (2) YOUR ADDRESS, AND (4) A
                    CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES
                    WITH US THROUGH ARBITRATION.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Any arbitration will be administered by the AAA under its
                    Commercial Arbitration Rules. If the value of the dispute is
                    $75,000 or less, its Supplementary Procedures for
                    Consumer-Related Disputes shall also be applicable. On
                    disputes involving $75,000 or less, we will punctually
                    reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA's and
                    arbitrator's fees and expenses. You agree to start
                    arbitration only in your county of permanent residence or in
                    California, US. We agree to commence arbitration only in
                    your county of residence. You may request a telephonic or
                    in-person hearing by following the AAA rules. In a dispute
                    involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic
                    unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person
                    hearing instead. The arbitrator may award the same damages
                    to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may
                    award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you
                    individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy
                    your individual claim. Nothing herein restricts Secure Your Mark
                    , LLC from demanding the arbitrator to award
                    Secure Your Mark, LLC all costs of the arbitration
                    including any Administrative Fees paid on your behalf.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    If the Dispute is not arbitrated by the choice of the
                    parties or a court does not compel arbitration if either
                    party elects to arbitrate for whatever reason, the Dispute
                    will be decided by a court without any right by either party
                    to a trial by jury. Any such court proceeding, including any
                    efforts to compel arbitration or initially filed lawsuits
                    that arise out of or relate to this Agreement or use of the
                    Sites shall be resolved exclusively by a court of proficient
                    jurisdiction located within California.

                  <h4>Entire Agreement</h4>
                  <p>
                    This Agreement, including the Privacy Policy, constitutes
                    the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the
                    subject matter hereof. No waiver by either party of any
                    breach or default hereunder is a waiver of any preceding or

                  </p>
                  <h4>Modifications to the Agreement</h4>
                  <p>
                    We reserve the right at all times to discontinue or alter
                    any of these terms and/or our Privacy Policy as we deem
                    necessary or desirable. Such changes may include, among
                    other things, the adding of certain fees or charges. We may,
                    but are not necessarily obligated to notify you via email of
                    any substantial changes, by sending you an e-mail to the
                    e-mail address that is registered with your account and/or
                    by posting notice of the change on the Website. Any changes
                    to this Agreement will be effective upon the advancing of
                    our transmittal of an e-mail notice to you or our posting of
                    notice of the changes on our Website. We suggest you,
                    therefore, re-read this section of our Website from time to
                    time to stay informed of any such changes. Use of the
                    Website by you after such notice shall be deemed to
                    constitute acceptance by you of such modifications.

                  <h4>Authorization</h4>
                  <p>
                    By submitting an order, you acknowledge that you are giving
                    us the authority to list ourselves, along with you, as a
                    recipient of correspondence from the USPTO related to your
                    trademarks. You may alter this at any time, but including us
                    allows us to better serve you and may prevent us from
                    providing certain services such as monitoring and
                    calendaring.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The Secure Your Mark strives to meet the trademark needs of
                    our customers in a professional, cordial, and effective
                    manner. We want every single customer to be 100% satisfied,
                    so we will work with any customer who has any questions or
                    concerns about their filings. Our customer service team is
                    made up of dedicated and courteous trademark representatives
                    with one goal - to meet each client's needs in a friendly,
                    caring, and efficient manner. If you do not think we have
                    met this goal, let us know and we will be happy to make
                    every effort to resolve the issues to your satisfaction. You
                    can send us an email at support@ustrademarkpros.com or call
                    us toll free at +1 (855) 267-6525.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    If we make any mistakes in your filing, we will do our level
                    best to admit it and make the necessary improvements needed
                    to fix the correction as soon as we can at no additional
                    cost to you. Please note the Secure Your Mark fees and all
                    government levied fees involved in your filing services are
                    non-refundable. The USPTO may experience delays or deny your
                    application without any fault of the Secure Your Mark.
                    These issues are beyond our control and will not be the
                    basis for a refund.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    If you decide that you want a refund, all such requests must
                    be submitted before the initial trademark search clearance
                    report is conducted. Your refund will be issued in the same
                    form that it was received. For example, if the payment to
                    Secure Your Mark, LLC was made by credit card then the
                    refund will be issued to the same credit card used to make
                    the payment. However, if you choose, you may request to
                    receive a credit for future Secure Your Mark, LLC
                    purchases/payments instead of a refund.
                  </p>
